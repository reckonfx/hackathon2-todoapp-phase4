# Specification Quality Checklist: Next.js UI Production Polish

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-02-07
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All 15 functional requirements are testable with clear MUST language
- 10 measurable success criteria defined with verification methods
- 5 assumptions documented to guide planning phase
- Safety constraints (no backend changes) explicitly stated in Phase Context and SC-009
- Spec references existing codebase patterns (CSS variables, Tailwind, CSS Modules) in Phase Context for planning context only, not as implementation mandates
