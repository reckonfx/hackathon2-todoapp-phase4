# Phase-1 Bundle Specification

## PROMPT_TEXT

Create a Phase-1 bundle for the existing CLI Todo application.

Requirements:
- Treat Phase-1 as complete and immutable
- Mark all Phase-1 specs as frozen
- Phase-1 must be referenceable but not editable
- No code changes
- No refactors
- No new features

Output:
- A clear declaration that Phase-1 is frozen
- A summary suitable for future phases to reference

## RESPONSE_TEXT

Created a complete Phase-1 bundle for the CLI Todo application with:
- Complete specification document (specs/001-phase-1-bundle/spec.md)
- Quality checklist (specs/001-phase-1-bundle/checklists/requirements.md)
- Phase-1 freeze declaration (specs/001-phase-1-bundle/phase-1-freeze-declaration.md)
- Quick reference guide for future phases (specs/001-phase-1-bundle/quick-reference.md)

All Phase-1 functionality has been documented and marked as frozen. The specifications clearly indicate that Phase-1 is complete and immutable, serving as a reference for future phases. The CLI Todo application functionality remains intact and is fully documented for future development.
