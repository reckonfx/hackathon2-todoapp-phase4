## Prompt

# 📜 Project Constitution
## Hackathon II – The Evolution of Todo

---

## 1. Purpose & Vision

The purpose of this project is to build a Todo application that evolves from a simple
in-memory console program into a fully distributed, cloud-native, AI-powered system.

This project is not about writing code manually.
It is about mastering **Spec-Driven Development**, **Reusable Intelligence**, and
**AI-Native Architecture**, where AI agents generate implementations based on precise,
well-governed specifications.

The long-term vision is to demonstrate how modern software systems can be designed
by humans as architects, while AI agents act as skilled implementers.

---

## 2. Core Principles (Non-Negotiable)

### 2.1 Spec-First Development
- Every feature MUST begin with a written specification.
- No code shall exist without a corresponding spec.
- Specifications are the single source of truth.

### 2.2 No Manual Coding
- Human-written production code is strictly forbidden.
- All implementation must be generated by Claude Code using Spec-Kit Plus.
- If output is incorrect, the specification must be refined — not the code.

### 2.3 Reusable Intelligence
- Intelligence must be abstracted into **Agents** and **Skills**.
- Skills must be reusable across phases and features.
- Behavior belongs to agents; execution belongs to tools.

### 2.4 Deterministic Architecture
- System behavior must be predictable and testable.
- AI agents must follow explicit behavioral rules defined in specs.
- Hidden or implicit logic is not allowed.

### 2.5 Progressive Evolution
- Each phase builds strictly on the previous phase.
- No phase may be skipped.
- Complexity increases gradually from CLI → Web → AI → Cloud → Distributed Systems.

---

## 3. Architectural Philosophy

### 3.1 Separation of Responsibilities
- **Specifications** define *what* and *why*
- **Agents** decide *how*
- **Skills** define *capabilities*
- **Tools** perform *actions*
- **Infrastructure** executes *at scale*

### 3.2 Agent-Centric Design
- Agents act as decision-makers.
- Agents never directly manipulate databases or infrastructure.
- Agents interact with the system exclusively through tools.

### 3.3 Skill-Driven Intelligence
- Skills represent reusable ess server with persisted conversation state.

### Phase IV — Local Cloud-Native Deployment
- Objective: Containerize and deploy the system on local Kubernetes.
- Interface: Kubernetes services
- Intelligence: AI-assisted DevOps and deployment.

### Phase V — Advanced Distributed Cloud System
- Objective: Implement event-driven architecture and advanced intelligence.
- Interface: Cloud-native microservices
- Intelligence: Event-driven agents, skills, and orchestration.

## 12. Technology Stack Governance

The following technology stack is constitutionally approved.
Substitutions are not permitted without constitutional amendment.

### Core Development
- Language (Backend): Python 3.13+
- Frocognitive abilities.
- Skills must be composable and phase-agnostic.
- Skills must not depend on UI or infrastructure details.

---

## 4. Specification Governance

### 4.1 Spec Structure
All specifications must live inside the `/specs` directory and follow Spec-Kit
conventions.

Specs must be categorized as:
- Feature specs (user-facing behavior)
- Agent & skill specs (intelligence)
- API specs (contracts)
- Data specs (models & schemas)
- Infrastructure specs (deployment behavior)

### 4.2 Spec Authority
- If implementation conflicts with spec → spec wins.
- If behavior is unclear → spec must be updated.
- Claude Code must always be instructed via spec references.

---

## 5. Phase-1 Constitutional Scope

### Phase-1 Objective
Build a **pure in-memory Python console Todo application** using spec-driven development.

### Phase-1 Constraints
- No databases
- No web interfaces
- No AI chatbot
- No external services
- “Phase-1 shall not use autonomous agents for business logic.
Governance agents are permitted strictly for specification validation and compliance.”

### Phase-1 Intelligence Rule
- No autonomous AI agent is required in Phase-1.
- However, **future agent compatibility must be preserved**.
- All logic must be written in a way that can later be controlled by agents.

---

## 6. Forward Compatibility Guarantees

The system MUST be designed such that:

- Phase-1 logic can be reused by:
  - Web APIs (Phase-2)
  - MCP tools (Phase-3)
  - Event handlers (Phase-5)

- Task operations remain:
  - Stateless
  - Deterministic
  - Tool-compatible

- No Phase-1 decision should block:
  - AI agent control
  - Kubernetes deployment
  - Event-driven execution

---

## 7. Quality Standards

### 7.1 Code Quality
- Clean, readable, modular structure
- Single responsibility per module
- Explicit error handling

### 7.2 Intelligence Quality
- Skills must be clearly named and scoped
- Agent behavior must be explainable
- Tool usage must be transparent

### 7.3 Documentation
- Every phase must update specs
- README must reflect current phase
- CLAUDE.md must guide AI behavior

---

## 8. Success Criteria

This project is successful if:

- All phases are completed strictly via specs
- Agents and skills are reusable and well-defined
- The system scales from CLI to cloud without rewrites
- The final chatbot can manage todos naturally and reliably
- The architecture reflects production-grade AI-native design

---

## 9. Constitutional Amendment Rule

This constitution may only be modified by:
- Explicit versioned updates
- Clear justification in documentation
- Maintaining backward compatibility with previous phases

Uncontrolled or ad-hoc changes are not permitted.

---

## 10. Final Declaration

This project treats AI not as a tool, but as a **collaborating engineer**.
The human role is to design intent, constraints, and architecture.
The AI role is to implement faithfully within those boundaries.

This constitution governs all decisions, specs, and implementations
for the lifetime of the project.

---

## 11. Project Phases (Authoritative Roadmap)

This project SHALL be executed strictly in the following phases.
Each phase builds upon the previous one and no phase may be skipped.

### Phase I — In-Memory Console Application
- Objective: Establish core task management logic.
- Interface: Command-line (CLI)
- Persistence: In-memory only
- Intelligence: No autonomous agent; future agent compatibility required.

### Phase II — Full-Stack Web Application
- Objective: Introduce persistence, multi-user support, and authentication.
- Interface: Web (Frontend + REST API)
- Persistence: PostgreSQL (Neon Serverless)
- Intelligence: Rule-based system only.

### Phase III — AI-Powered Todo Chatbot
- Objective: Enable natural language task management.
- Interface: Conversational UI (Chat)

## Response snapshot

I have updated the project constitution at `.specify/memory/constitution.md` based on your provided draft. I also propagated these constitutional changes to the key templates (`plan-template.md`, `spec-template.md`, and `tasks-template.md`) to ensure all future features comply with the defined principles and Phase-I constraints.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Established core project governance and authoritative roadmap.
- 🧪 Tests: n/a
- 📁 Files: Updated constitution and 3 dependent templates.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Begin first feature specification for Phase-I.
- 🧠 Reflection: The spec-driven approach is now formalized through the constitution and reinforced in the workflow templates.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: none
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): default
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Introduce feature one.
